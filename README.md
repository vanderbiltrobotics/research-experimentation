# research-experimentation

This repository is for code that is not meant to run on the mining robot itself. Use this repository to mess around with algorithms and see how they work or to determine if something could possibly be used for the competition robot. 

If you are disigning an actual ROS node or software meant for the actual robot, use the [NASA-RMC-2018-2019](https://github.com/vanderbiltrobotics/NASA-RMC-2018-2019) repository. 

If you are are looking for something we covered in a workshop or want to add some sort of lesson for others to see, use the [Programming-Workshops](https://github.com/vanderbiltrobotics/Programming-Workshops) repository
